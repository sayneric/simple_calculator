(1) (User Interface and Input Handling + Display Result):

    Implement the user interface to display the menu of operations.
    Handle user input for operation selection and number input.
    Call the appropriate arithmetic function based on the user's choice.
    Display the result of the operation to the user.

(2)(Arithmetic Operations + Error Handling + User Interaction):

    Implement the arithmetic functions (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
    Handle division by zero and other error conditions.
    Implement the loop that keeps the calculator running.
    Handle user input for continuing or quitting the calculator.

Project: Calculator

1. User Interface and Input Handling:

    Display a menu of available operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
    Prompt the user to select an operation.
    Accept user input for the numbers on which the operation will be performed.

2. Arithmetic Operations:

    Implement functions for each arithmetic operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
    Pass the input numbers to the appropriate function based on the user's selected operation.
    Calculate the result of the operation.

3. Display Result:

    Display the result of the operation to the user.

4. Error Handling:

    Check for division by zero and handle this situation gracefully.
    Handle invalid input (e.g., non-numeric input) from the user.

5. User Interaction:

    After displaying the result, prompt the user if they want to perform another operation.
    Handle user input for continuing or quitting the calculator.

6. Main Loop:

    Set up a loop that keeps the calculator running until the user decides to quit.

7. Additional Features (Optional):

    Allow the user to perform multiple operations in succession.
    Implement memory functions (store, recall, clear memory).
    Add support for more complex operations like exponentiation or square root.
